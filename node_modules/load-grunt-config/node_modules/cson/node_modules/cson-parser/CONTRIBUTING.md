make sure you are using the latest versions of the code.

When reporting a bug with this library,
please provide a minimal test case.
This can be a gist,
inline in the description,
or in the form of a pull request
that includes a failing test.

If you are contributing a bug fix,
make sure it has a passing test
in your pull request.

## Adding a Feature

Before implementing features,
try to make sure that
(1) no one else is currently working on that and
(2) you have checked with the maintainers
that this is something they would like to see.

All features should have tests.
