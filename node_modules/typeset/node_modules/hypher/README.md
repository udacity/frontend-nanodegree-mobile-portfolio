## Hypher

A small and fast JavaScript hyphenation engine. Can be used in Node.js and as a jQuery plugin.

## Node.js
Hypher can be installed from NPM:

    npm install hypher hyphenation.en-us

You can then use it in your program by creating an instance of `Hypher` and giving it a language object:

    var Hypher = require('hypher'),
        english = require('hyphenation.en-us'),
        h = new Hypher(english);

    // returns ['hy', 'phen', 'ation']
    h.hyphenate('hyphenation');

See `examples/node/` for a full example on how to use Hypher. The `hyphenate` method does not support hyphenated compound words. These should be split into individual words before being passed to the hyphenation engine and reassembled afterwards by the caller. You can also use the `hyphenateText` method to hyphenate a string of text. The `hyphenateText` method *does* support compound words and returns a string with inserted soft hyphens (`\u00AD`.)

    // returns 'Hy|phen|ation is use|ful when cen|ter jus|ti|fy|ing a text.' where `|` is a soft hyphen
    h.hyphenateText('Hyphenation is useful when center justifying a text.');

The `hyphenateText` method takes an optional second parameter `minLength` which is the minimum length a word should have to be considerd for hyphenation (defaults to 4.) Note that an instance of the `Hypher` class should only be created once for each language object.

The language object should contain:

    {
      // The minimum number of unhyphenated characters at the left of each word. (required)
      leftmin: <number>, 

      // The minimum number of unhyphenated characters at the right of each word. (required)
      rightmin: <number>,

      // A comma separated list of hyphenation exceptions. Custom hyphenations
      // can be specified using '\u2027' (hyphenation point) as hyphenation
      // character. List items are case-insensitive. (Optional)
      exceptions: <string>,

      // A patterns object (required)
      patterns: {}
    }

Language patterns can be found in the [patterns repository](https://github.com/bramstein/hyphenation-patterns).

##jQuery

To use the jQuery plugin include `dist/jquery.hypher.js` in your HTML document together with any number of language pattern files from the `dist/browser` directory in the [patterns repository](https://github.com/bramstein/hyphenation-patterns). It is important that you include `jquery.hypher.js` before any language pattern files.

    <script src="jquery.hypher.js"></script>
    <script src="en-us.js"></script>

This will extend jQuery with a `hyphenate` method. Given the following HTML:

    <p>Hyphenation is <em>important</em></p>

You can hyphenate the text content of the `p` element like so:

    $('p').hyphenate('en-us');

The `hyphenate` method only works on the text content of the elements it is called on, so in the above example the word "important" will not be hyphenated. To also include the text content of the `em` element, simply include it in your selector:

    $('p, em').hyphenate('en-us');

This naturally also applies to your own classes:

    $('p.hyphenate, em, a').hyphenate('en-us');

This will hyphenate only `p` with class `hyphenate` and `em` and `a` elements.

## Ender

Assuming you have [Ender](http://ender.no.de/) installed you can either add Hypher and a hyphenation pattern to your library by using the command line `ender build hypher hyphenation.en-us`, or include them in your dependencies in your `package.json`:

    "dependencies": {
      "hypher": "*",
      "hyphenation.en-us": "*"
    }

and build your library as usual with `ender build .`. Then---as in jQuery---hyphenate the selected elements:

    $('p').hyphenate('en-us');

The `examples/ender/` directory contains an example project using Ender and Hypher.
