      |- critical.js
      |- css.js
      |- delete.js

      |- images.js
      |- scripts.js
  |- default.js
  |- config.js
  |- node_modules/
  |- gulpfile.js
  |- package.json

```

Each task is broken into a separate file and config.js serves as the
configuration file for each task.

* `gulp` launches browsersync
* `gulp html` generates and inlines critical-path CSS via `gulp critical` task and minifies index.html, outputting the result in dist folder
* `gulp scripts` uglifies perfmatters.js
* `gulp images:pizza` and `gulp images:profile` generates optimized jpg and webp images
* `gulp clean` cleans dist folder and .tmp
