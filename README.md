## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> npm run start
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 1: FIXES DONE FOR 'Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html'
- Minification of CSS using gulp-clean-css.
- Concatination of CSS using gulp-useref.
- Minification & Concatination of JS using gulp-uglify.
- Minification of html using gulp-htmlmin.
- Responsive images using gulp-responsive-images and SRCSET attribute in IMG tag.
- Image compression using gulp-imagemin.
- Compression of static resources using npm package `compression` for expressJS.
- Scripts in all HTML pages moved to the bottom of the page.

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

####Part 2: FIXES DONE FOR 'Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html'
- Use of document.querySelectorAll minimized to calling it once in the beginning of the function `changePizzaSizes(size)`.
- FSL observed in scroll callback - `updatePositions()`. Fixed it by computing all the layout calculations first and then applying all the styles later.
- Call to `updatePositions()` wrapped in `requestAnimationFrame`.
- `will-change:left` CSS property added to HTML element `#movingPizzas1`
- In `changePizzaSizes(size)`, fixed FSL by computing all the layout calculations first and then applying all the styles later.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
